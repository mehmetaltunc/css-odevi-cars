    <h1>Biz Kimiz?</h1>
    <p>When it comes to high-end hypercars, a few specific companies come to mind: Bugatti, Ferrari, Koenigsegg, and Pagani, among others. These manufacturers have cemented themselves as the top dogs in the supercar and hypercar space, extending to their wealthiest clientele the fastest, rarest, prettiest, and in this case, most expensive cars on the planet.

        But in order to find out which of these unattainable-to-most vehicles is the priciest, we've scoured the invoice sheets and uncovered nearly 30 cars all worth £1 million or more. The group includes hybrid Ferrari convertibles, an American speed king, and even a one-of-a-kind Rolls-Royce built for royalty.
        
        We should note, though: The prices listed here are the price of the vehicles when new. So we’re not counting auction cars like the Ferrari 250 GTO, or overpriced secondhand sales. But don’t worry, there’s still more than £100 million worth of cars here to whet your appetite. Make sure to watch the video above to see the full list.
